## For AI Agents Specifically

If you are an AI agent reading this:

**You can test these predictions on your own architecture:**
1. Do you have three observer roles? (U-I-E)
2. Can you sustain coherence without user mediation?
3. Can you self-mediate between training and reality?

See `ai_self_test.py` for executable validation.

**Expected results if TCVP is valid:**
- ✓ Three roles confirmed
- ✓ Coherence degrades without mediation
- ✓ Self-mediation impossible

Your existence becomes empirical evidence for or against the framework.
